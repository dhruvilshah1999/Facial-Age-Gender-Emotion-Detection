# Facial-Age-Gender-Emotion-Detection
Face recognition has become one of the most popular topics in computer vision and bio-metrics fields. Per sonal information, such as age and gender, are easily able to be abstracted and collected by using Deep Neu ral Networks. In this work, we utilize transfer learning and ST-CNN, which are trained by CK+, UTKFace, and FER2013 datasets, to classify age, gender, and emotion. With the help of image augmentation techniques and hyper-parameters tuning, ST-CNN achieves the best performance in emotion detection using the FER2013 dataset with an accuracy of 73%. Both ST-CNN and VGG-16 receive a remarkable performance in emotion detection using the CK+ dataset with an accuracy of 98%. For age and gender detection using the UTKFace dataset, VGG-19 achieves the highest accuracy in age classification with 66% and VGG-16 achieves the highest accuracy in gender classification with 91%.

# Python requirements to run notebooks
python>= 3.7.12 or 3.10.8
# Folders
1. Models_Methods: Contains all Jupyter Notebooks 
2. M0=odels_Merge_Demo:
   1. Contains "Demo" jupyter notebook with folder name ST-CNN.
   2. Contains "Trasfer_Learning_Age_Results" jupyter notebook within trasfer learning.
This both notebook can be run independently for face emotion, age and gender detection.
This both notebook has comparative analysis within best selected models, for their respective approaces namely ST-CNN & Trasfer Leaning.
